# Digits in a Sequence
Given an index in an infinite sequence
`112123123412345123456123456712345678123456789123456789101234567891011...`
return the digit at that position.

Generating the whole sequence up to the asked index is inefficient, this implementation finds out the answer directly through calculation.

The given index `i` is in range `1 <= i <= 10^10`.
